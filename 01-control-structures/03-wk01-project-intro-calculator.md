## Calculator Submission

You will submit this Calculator project by following these special directions. These directions will get you to put your Calculator code in a repl, and then share that repl with us.

Work on your solution until you are ready to submit. Then...

1. Run your Ruby code and check the Terminal to make sure that no errors show up on the screen
1. Visit [repl.it](https://repl.it/), a place where you can quickly create public/shareable code snippets
1. Log into repl.it if you have an account, or would like to make one
1. Click on "Start Coding." Select "Ruby" as the programming language, and create a new repl.
1. **Paste** in your Calculator exercise:
    - Inside of the big box, paste all of your Calculator code: Copy and paste your _entire_ file into this box
1. **Find the URL** of this page (`cmd+l` as a shortcut), **copy it** onto your clipboard, and then **paste it into the submission box below.**
    - Make sure that this URL is the correct URL first by pasting it into a new browser tab or window.

These submission directions will evolve over time as we learn more skills, so please be alert.
