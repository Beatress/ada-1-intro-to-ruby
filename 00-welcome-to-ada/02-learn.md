# Intro to Learn

[Learn](http://learn-2.galvanize.com/) is a Learning Management tool, developed by [Galvanize](https://www.galvanize.com/) designed specifically for the needs of bootcamp students.  Ada is excited to be using this tool for the first time in C14.  

## What's in Learn?

In Learn you will find Ada's curriculum written by your (and past) instructors at Ada.  

You will also find assessments we have created to help identify areas of mastery and concepts we need to reinforce.  The assessments include multiple-choice, short-answer and free-response questions as well as programming assignments.    You have already experienced these lessons and assignments in the Pre-Ada Material.

## Grades

Learn does track percentage scores.  We cannot turn that off, but we will not use overall percentage scores to assess students.

At Ada we assess students primarily through programming projects, exercises known as PSEs, and some CS Fun assignments. In most cases, the scale will be as such:

* Green
  * You have met or exceeded the major learning goals for this project; there is evidence that the produced code shows enough understanding
* Yellow
*  You approached meeting the major learning goals for this project; to the grader, there is evidence that the produced code shows some understanding, and shows evidence that not all major learning goals were met
* Red
  * You did not meet the major learning goals for this project; there is evidence that most major learning goals were not met, the progress on the project shows need for support on completion, quality, or both; the project is broken and not running

In general, you may resubmit work as many times as you like, however Ada moves at a fairly rapid pace and you are encouraged after submitting an assignment and getting feedback, to absorb the feedback and apply that learning on new projects, unless otherwise directed.

## Organization

Learn is organized into **Sections**.  Each section is a major unit of study at Ada.  The Pre-Ada Material was such a unit.
