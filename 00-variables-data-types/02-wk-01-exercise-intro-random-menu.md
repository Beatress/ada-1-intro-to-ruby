## Random Menu Submission

You will submit this Random Menu exercise by following these special directions. These directions will get you to put your Random Menu code in a gist, and then share that gist with us.

Work on your solution until you are ready to submit. Then...

1. Run your Ruby code and check the Terminal to make sure that no errors show up on the screen
1. Visit [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/), a place on GitHub where you can quickly create public/shareable "gists" (small pieces) of code
1. Log into GitHub.com
1. Use the form to **paste** in details about your Random Menu exercise:
    - Gist Description...: Include your name and "Random Menu" (ex: `Simon D - Random Menu`)
    - Filename including extension: `random-menu.rb`
    - Inside of the big box, where you paste your code: Copy and paste your _entire_ file into this box
1. Click either "Create secret gist" or "Create private gist."
    - Either is fine.
1. The browser redirects you to a new page, which is just your gist. **Find the URL** of this page (`cmd+l` as a shortcut), **copy it** onto your clipboard, and then **paste it into the submission box below.**
    - Make sure that this URL is the correct URL first by pasting it into a new browser tab or window.

These submission directions will evolve over time as we learn more skills, so please be alert.
